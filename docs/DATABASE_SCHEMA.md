* Search history
* AI conversations
* Product recommendations
* User preferences
* Saved recommendations
* Future scalability

## Database Design Principles

* UUID primary keys
* Normalized schema
* Row Level Security (RLS)
* Soft deletion where appropriate
* Audit timestamps on every table
* Strict foreign key relationships
* Minimal data duplication
* Optimized indexes for search performance

# Row Level Security

Enable RLS on every user-owned table.

Policy:

Users may only

* Read their own data
* Insert their own data
* Update their own data
* Delete their own data

Public marketplace metadata (if later introduced) can have separate read-only policies.

---

# Triggers

## updated_at Trigger

Automatically updates

```
updated_at
```

on every UPDATE.

Applies to

* profiles
* preferences
* conversations

---

# Constraints

* Every profile must map to exactly one authenticated user.
* Every preference record belongs to exactly one profile.
* Every search session belongs to one profile.
* Every recommendation belongs to one search session.
* Every marketplace result belongs to one recommendation and one normalized product.
* Messages cannot exist without a conversation.
* Saved items cannot exist without both a profile and a recommendation.

---

# Data Lifecycle

## Search

1. User submits a query or uploads an image.
2. A `search_session` is created.
3. AI processes the request.
4. Normalized `products` are matched or created.
5. `marketplace_results` are stored.
6. A `recommendation` is generated.
7. `review_analysis` and `seller_analysis` are attached to each listing.
8. A `search_history` record is written.
9. The user may save the recommendation to `saved_items`.

---

# Future Extensions

The schema is intentionally extensible to support:

* Affiliate links and commission tracking
* Price history
* Wishlist collections
* Shared recommendation links
* Browser extension synchronization
* Product availability monitoring
* Price drop alerts
* Voice shopping sessions
* Multi-language support
* Team or family shopping accounts

No breaking schema changes should be required to support these future capabilities; only additive tables and relationships should be necessary.
