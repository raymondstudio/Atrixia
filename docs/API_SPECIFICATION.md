# API Design Principles

* Every endpoint has a single responsibility.
* All business logic resides in the service layer, not route handlers.
* All responses follow a consistent JSON structure.
* Authentication is required for all user-specific resources.
* External AI providers and marketplace integrations are abstracted behind internal service interfaces.
* APIs are stateless, idempotent where appropriate, and designed for future extensibility.
* All endpoints must provide meaningful error messages and predictable response formats.
* Every request and response should be fully type-safe and documented through shared TypeScript interfaces.
