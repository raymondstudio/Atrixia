# BUILD_PLAN.md

# Atrixia Development Build Plan v1.0

**Project:** Atrixia

**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Approved for Development

**Objective:** Deliver a polished, production-quality MVP for the Gemma 4 Hackathon. Every task below includes a clear definition of done and should be completed sequentially unless explicitly marked as parallelizable.

---

# Development Principles

* Build vertical slices, not isolated features.
* Keep the application deployable after every completed milestone.
* Do not leave placeholder code in production branches.
* Every feature must include loading, empty, and error states.
* Every major feature must be responsive.
* Every pull request should compile successfully without warnings or TypeScript errors.
* No use of `any` in TypeScript.
* No hardcoded secrets.
* Follow the architecture documents without deviation.

# Definition of Project Completion

The project is considered complete when a first-time user can:

1. Sign up or log in.
2. Search for a product using text or an image.
3. Answer AI clarification questions if needed.
4. Receive a personalized AI recommendation with explanations, confidence score, trade-offs, and alternatives.
5. Compare marketplace listings.
6. Save recommendations and review search history.
7. Follow a marketplace link to complete a purchase.
8. Use the application seamlessly on desktop and mobile.

The final deliverable should feel like a polished AI-native shopping assistant rather than a hackathon prototype, demonstrating a complete end-to-end user experience, a modular architecture, and a production-ready engineering approach.
