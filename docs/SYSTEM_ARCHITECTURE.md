# Atrixia System Architecture v1.0

**Project:** Atrixia

**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Approved for Development

**Purpose:** This document defines the complete technical architecture of Atrixia. It is the authoritative reference for all engineering decisions and implementation. Every module, service, API, and component must conform to this architecture.

---

# 1. Architecture Principles

Atrixia is designed around five core engineering principles.

## AI First

AI is the primary product capability. Every major user interaction should either leverage AI reasoning directly or support AI-driven decision making.

---

## Modular

Every major subsystem should be independently replaceable without affecting the rest of the application.

Examples:

* Switching Gemini to OpenAI
* Adding another marketplace
* Adding another authentication provider

should require minimal code changes.

---

## Provider Agnostic

The application should never directly depend on one AI provider or one marketplace.

Instead, all integrations must go through adapters/interfaces.

---

## Scalable

Although the MVP is built for a hackathon, the architecture should support future production scaling without major restructuring.

---

## Type Safe

All frontend and backend code must use strict TypeScript.

No usage of `any`.

Shared types should be reused across client and server.

---

* shadcn/ui
* Framer Motion

---

## Backend

* Next.js Route Handlers
* TypeScript

---

## Database

Supabase PostgreSQL

---

## Authentication

Supabase Auth

Supported providers

* Email
* Google

Architecture should allow future providers.

---

## Storage

Stores:

* Uploaded images
* User avatars

---

## AI Runtime

Primary

Gemini 2.5 Flash / Pro & local Gemma 2/4 (via Vercel AI SDK Google/Vertex Provider)

Architecture prepared for

* GPT
* Claude
* DeepSeek
* Qwen

---

## Deployment

Frontend

Vercel

Backend

Next.js API Routes

Database

Supabase

---

# 4. System Modules

The system consists of independent modules.

---

## Authentication Module

Responsibilities

* Client-side signup/login using `@supabase/ssr` and PKCE flow.
* Next.js Middleware-based session validation & route protection.
* Profile & Preferences Synchronization via triggers.

Owns

Users

Sessions

Profiles

Preferences

---

## Search Module

Responsibilities

Natural language search.

Converts user intent into structured search requests.

Example

Input

"I need a laptop for programming under $900."

Output

```
Category:
Laptop

Budget:
900

Purpose:
Programming

Priority:
Battery
```

---

## Image Analysis Module

Responsibilities

Accept uploaded image.

Identify

* Product

Returns structured product metadata.

---

## Marketplace Module

Responsibilities

Query marketplace providers.

Normalize product information.

Deduplicate similar products.

Return standardized listings.

### Scraper Architecture & Rate Limiting
- **Resiliency Adapter Pattern:** Employs a proxy-backed aggregator with configurable retry backoffs.
- **Fallback mock client:** Actively checks network responses; if rate-limited or blocked, gracefully switches to realistic mock JSON datasets.

---

## Recommendation Module

Core intelligence of the application.

Responsibilities

Receive normalized listings.

Analyze

Price

Ratings

Shipping

Seller

Review quality

Generate

Recommendation

Alternatives

---

## API Responsibilities

---

## Business Logic

No UI logic.

No database queries.

Only application rules.

---

## Database Layer

Policies

---

# 8. AI Provider Layer

The application should never directly call an AI provider.

Instead

```
AIProvider

↓

GeminiAdapter

Future

GPTAdapter

ClaudeAdapter

DeepSeekAdapter
```

Every provider must expose

```
analyzeImage()

chat()

recommend()

summarizeReviews()

generateConfidence()
```

This allows providers to be swapped without changing business logic.

---

# 9. Marketplace Layer

Every marketplace follows the same interface.

```
MarketplaceProvider

↓

Amazon

eBay

Jumia

AliExpress

Future Providers
```

Each provider returns

```
MarketplaceResult

{

title

image

price

currency

rating

seller

shipping

marketplace

url

}
```

The recommendation engine never knows which marketplace produced the data.

# 27. Architectural Constraints

* No component may directly communicate with the database.
* No UI component may contain business logic.
* All AI interactions must go through the AI Provider Layer.
* All marketplace interactions must go through the Marketplace Layer.
* Business logic must remain independent of UI.
* Shared types must be reused between frontend and backend.
* API routes must remain thin and delegate logic to services.
* Every external dependency must be abstracted behind an interface.
* The Recommendation Engine is the only module authorized to produce final purchasing recommendations.

# Final Architecture Statement

Atrixia is designed as an AI-first, modular, provider-agnostic platform where intelligence—not marketplace integration—is the core product. Every architectural decision prioritizes maintainability, extensibility, explainability, and user trust. The system separates presentation, business logic, AI reasoning, marketplace integration, and persistence into distinct layers, ensuring that future growth, provider changes, and new features can be introduced with minimal impact on the overall application architecture.
