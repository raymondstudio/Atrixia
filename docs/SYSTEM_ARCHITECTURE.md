# Atrixia System Architecture v1.0

**Project:** Atrixia

**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Approved for Development

**Purpose:** This document defines the complete technical architecture of Atrixia. It is the authoritative reference for all engineering decisions and implementation. Every module, service, API, and component must conform to this architecture.

---

# 1. Architecture Principles

Atrixia is designed around five core engineering principles.

## AI First

AI is the primary product capability. Every major user interaction should either leverage AI reasoning directly or support AI-driven decision making.

---

## Modular

Every major subsystem should be independently replaceable without affecting the rest of the application.

Examples:

* Switching Gemini to OpenAI
* Adding another marketplace
* Adding another authentication provider

should require minimal code changes.

---

## Provider Agnostic

The application should never directly depend on one AI provider or one marketplace.

Instead, all integrations must go through adapters/interfaces.

---

## Scalable

Although the MVP is built for a hackathon, the architecture should support future production scaling without major restructuring.

---

## Type Safe

All frontend and backend code must use strict TypeScript.

No usage of `any`.

Shared types should be reused across client and server.

---

---

## API Responsibilities

---

## Business Logic

No UI logic.

No database queries.

Only application rules.

---

## Database Layer

Policies

---

# 8. AI Provider Layer

The application should never directly call an AI provider.

Instead

```
AIProvider

↓

GeminiAdapter

Future

GPTAdapter

ClaudeAdapter

DeepSeekAdapter
```

Every provider must expose

```
analyzeImage()

chat()

recommend()

summarizeReviews()

generateConfidence()
```

This allows providers to be swapped without changing business logic.

---

# 9. Marketplace Layer

Every marketplace follows the same interface.

```
MarketplaceProvider

↓

Amazon

eBay

Jumia

AliExpress

Future Providers
```

Each provider returns

```
MarketplaceResult

{

title

image

price

currency

rating

seller

shipping

marketplace

url

}
```

The recommendation engine never knows which marketplace produced the data.

---

# 12. Decision Engine

Every recommendation evaluates

Price

Shipping

Ratings

Authenticity

Seller Trust

Review Sentiment

Return Policy (if available)

Overall Value

Never rank by price alone.

---

# 13. Confidence Engine

Every recommendation returns

```
Confidence

0–100%
```

Calculated using

Data Completeness

Review Quality

Listing Similarity

Seller Trust

Image Match

Information Consistency

---

# 14. Review Intelligence

The AI should summarize customer feedback.

Instead of

4.7★

Generate

Pros

Cons

Common Complaints

Who Should Buy

Who Should Avoid

---

# 15. Explainability Layer

Every recommendation must answer

Why?

Trade-offs?

Alternatives?

Confidence?

No recommendation should ever be unexplained.

---

# 16. Database Architecture

Primary entities

Users

Profiles

Preferences

Searches

Products

MarketplaceListings

Recommendations

Conversations

Messages

History

Relationships should use UUID primary keys.

Soft deletes where appropriate.

# 27. Architectural Constraints

* No component may directly communicate with the database.
* No UI component may contain business logic.
* All AI interactions must go through the AI Provider Layer.
* All marketplace interactions must go through the Marketplace Layer.
* Business logic must remain independent of UI.
* Shared types must be reused between frontend and backend.
* API routes must remain thin and delegate logic to services.
* Every external dependency must be abstracted behind an interface.
* The Recommendation Engine is the only module authorized to produce final purchasing recommendations.

# Final Architecture Statement

Atrixia is designed as an AI-first, modular, provider-agnostic platform where intelligence—not marketplace integration—is the core product. Every architectural decision prioritizes maintainability, extensibility, explainability, and user trust. The system separates presentation, business logic, AI reasoning, marketplace integration, and persistence into distinct layers, ensuring that future growth, provider changes, and new features can be introduced with minimal impact on the overall application architecture.
